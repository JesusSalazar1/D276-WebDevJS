            Dear <em>Hiring Manager</em>,
            </p>

            <p>
            My name is Jesus Salazar, and I am interest in the <mark>junior cloud engineer role</mark> at Cloud Company. I am soon to graduate from my B.S. in IT from WGU and have
            worked on gathering more cloud related skills. I am eager to begin working with the cloud and enable customers with their cloud aspirations.

                During my time as a systems administrator, I have worked with multiple IT technologies that can be leveraged to improve my performance as a cloud engineer.
                I have expertise in resolving DNS, networking, and hardware issues. I have proven customer service skills by working with other departments to enable them to accomplish their goals.
                I've worked in high stress situations and am able to work in a fast paced environment, namely having worked for the United States Marine Corps. I have also worked with L3Harris as a systems administrator
                and in that position led with transferring out server stack from a mainly hardware to virtualized environment.

            <p>
                Joining Cloud Company is an opportunity for me to grow and advanced my skills and enable companies to expand. I am confident that my eagerness to grow and my background in IT make me a strong
                fit for this role. Thank you for considering me; I look forward to discussing soon.
            </p>
        

        
        <p>
            Sincerely,<br>
